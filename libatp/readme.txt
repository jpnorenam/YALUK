Instructions to compile the ATP
-------------------------------

I- To change the dimensions

1.  Edit the file  listsize.ext, and set  the  size of  each
table as required.

2.  Run  the  command  file  vardimn.  Vardimn  runs
vardim and the files dimdef.f and newmods.f are created.

     # ./vardimn listsize.ext

If DISLIN graphic library is  not present, a  dummy  library
dislin.a can be used, as explained in makefile.

DISLIN  is  available via  ftp anonymous  from the following
site:

www.mps.de/dislin


4. Run make with makefile as argument.

     # make

II. To obtain a COMPILED TACS version of tpbig.

At first, set  environment  variable COMPTACS as "MAKE", and
run.

     # COMPTACS=MAKE
     # rm comtac.o
     # ./runtp datafile

   Then, the following three files are created.

    decktac1.inc
    decktac2.inc
    codetacs.inc

This  files  must be copied  to  comta1.ins,  comta2.ins and
comta3.ins respectively, as required by comtac.f.

It is better to include "SINGLE STEP IF MAKE" in data files.
By  this command, tpbig stops immediately after creating the
above three files.  Without this command, tpbig doesn't stop
until the simulation reaches tmax.

The batch file  comtac1 does this work,  with your  data
file as argument

    # ./comtac1 data

The above three files  are included by comtac.f module.  The
new tpbig  is created by compiling comtac.f and linking with
other modules.


2. Run make with makefile as argument.

    # make

A lot  of  warning  messages  can  be  avoided  by  changing
dimensions in  tacsar.ins and comtacs.f to the same value as
SPTACS dimension in newmods.f.

3. Then, set environment variable COMPTACS as "USE", and run
the new tpbig.

    # COMPTACS=USE
    # tpbig  DISK datafile. s -r
    # COMPTACS=

The batch file  comtac2 does  this  work  with your data
file as argument.

    # ./comtac2 data

The original  tpbig  in the  distribution  was compiled with
the following three files whose  sizes are  0.

comtac1.ins
comtac2.ins
comtac3.ins


 Some tips for the correct operating of compiled TACS
  - Some varible names should not be used; I, IA, T, ...
  - The integer number should not be used as a denominator;
    1/2 should be 1.D0/2.D0 , .....
  - Logical expression should be changed by hand;

    For example,
      SIGAP   = .NOT. SIGA
      This code should be changed like as follows;
AASIGAP   = .NOT.SIGA
BB  IF ( SIGA .GT. 0.0 ) then
BB       SIGAP = 0.0
BB         ELSE
BB       SIGAP = 1.0
BB      ENDIF

    Other example,
     SIGNLC  = SIGN( ERRORC ) * ( ABS( ERRORC ) .GT. DELTAI )
     This code should be changed like as follows;
AASIGNLC  = SIGN( ERRORC ) * ( ABS( ERRORC ) .GT. DELTAI )
BB   IF ( DABS( ERRORC ) .GT. DELTAI ) THEN
BB     SIGNLC  = SIGNZ( ERRORC ) * 1.0D0
BB   ELSE
BB     SIGNLC = 0.D0
BB   ENDIF

III. To add a foreign function to MODELS.

1. Edit the file fgnmod.f and add your function.

   Follow the instructions in the fgnmod.f

2. Run make with makefile as argument.

    # make
