NXOFF   is the horizontal offset of the grid in thousandths of an inch.
NYOFF   is the vertical   offset of the grid in thousandths of an inch.
        An increase in NXOFF means the grid (and axes, curves, etc.) will
        be moved to the right within the plot window.  An increase in NYOFF
        means the grid is moved upward within the plot window.  NXOFF  and
        NYOFF  are margins on the left and bottom.

NXID6   Horizontal location for start of plot legend in thousandths of an inch.
NYID6   Vertical   location for start of plot legend in thousandths of an inch.
        Only  SPY PLOT  is involved (the location of the CALCOMP PLOT legend
        is controlled by very old variables within  STARTUP).  In the above,
        "location"  refers to the start of the legend  ---  the left edge of
        the top line of the several lines.  Zero  NYID6  corresponds to the top
        of the plot window.  Vertical distance is measured positively downward.
        Horizontal location increases as one moves left to right.

NXVERN  is horizontal location of Y-axis numbers,  in thousandths of an inch.
NYVERN  is vertical   location of 1st Y-axis number, in thousandths of an inch.
        Only  SPY PLOT  is involved (CALCOMP PLOT axis numbers are unaffected).
        As with the preceding legend,  location refers to the start of the
        number.  Increasing NXVERN will move Y-axis numbers to the right.
        Increasing NYVERN will move Y-axis numbers downward.

IDXBAS  is the width  of characters of the base font, in monitor pixels.
IDYBAS  is the height of characters of the base font, in monitor pixels.
        These numbers no longer are used for vector screen graphics.  DISLIN 
        uses the single  MULFNT  below as an alternative.  So,  IDXBAS  and
        IDYBAS  can be ignored except for PostScript output if NOPOST = 0.
        Because of PostScript output,  we continue using values of years past.
        
        are largely arbitrary,  since MULFNT will scale the text,
        anyway.  Later,  either this pair of sizes or MULFNT is expected to
        disappear.  Obviously,  one does not need 3 parameters to control the
        size of text.

JXDISL  Horizontal pixels that locate of upper-left corner of the plot window.
JYDISL  Vertical   pixels that locate of upper-left corner of the plot window.
        Normally,  the user will ignore this parameter pair,  which then will
        be set to  (1, 1)  which corresponds to the upper-left corner of the
        screen.  The idea is to have graphics above and text (ATP printout)
        below.

NXDISL  Pixels of horizontal resolution for the monitor being used. 
NYDISL  Pixels of vertical   resolution for the monitor being used. 

JSLOW   Artificial added time delay in milliseconds after each refresh of a
        ROLLing  SPY  PLOT.  For any positive value,  one line of output to
        the DOS window of the screen (not the .LIS file) will document each
        such waste of time.  Note  KSLOWR  of  STARTUP  defines the frequency
        of plot refreshing.

NODISK  is a binary switch that allows the suppression of  DISLIN  graphics
        during  DISK  use.  Value unity will suppress the graphics whereas
        value zero will not.  Note the difference compared with Salford EMTP,
        which automatically suppressed screen graphics during  DISK  use.
        With  GNU ATP  and  DISLIN,  this decision is left to the user.

KLIPX   Meaning depends on the sign.  For full-width plotting, there is a
        minus sign,  and the absolute value will be small.  Then  -KLIPX =
        is the number of X pixels that are to be removed from  NXDISL  as
        the plot window is defined.  If zero,  the right side of the window
        frame will be missing.  Value 3 is enough to show the frame, which
        reassures the user that nothing has been lost on the right.  This
        represents waste, but is an aesthetically pleasing choice.  This is
        for a negative value.  For a positive value, the name and meaning
JXPERC  change.  JXPERC > 0 is the width of the graphic window as a 
        percentage of the total screen width  NXDISL.

JYPERC  is the height of the graphic window as a percentage of the total
        screen height  NYDISL.  Value 60 is referred to as full-height,  
        although 80% and 93% have been used (see  HIGHER*.AUX).

INCHX   is the width  of the plot window in thousandths of an inch.
INCHY   is the height of the plot window in thousandths of an inch.
        Remember that the Y axis is 8 inches high,  and the time axis is
        20 inches long (for full width).  So this pair of numbers should
        allow some extra space on all sides.  Something such as 10 and 22
        thousand are reasonable.  These two numbers provide magnification.
        The grid size varies inversely with these numbers.  As more space
        is allowed,  less is used,  so a plot becomes smaller.

JTICW   is half the width  of an axis tic mark, in thousandths of an inch.
JTICH   is half the length of an axis tic mark, in thousandths of an inch.
        Generally,  the second number will be 5 or more times the first.
        X-axis tic marks will be drawn using the color of the X axis.  But
        Y-axis tic marks will be drawn using the color of the grid in order
        not to interfere with Y-axis numbers.

MULFNT  is an empirical scaling factor for text.  Values as small as 200
        and as large as 400 have been used.  "Beauty is in the eye of the  
        beholder."  Were it not for  QUARTER PLOT,  a larger value probably
        would be used.  As  QUART.DAT  illustrates,  value 300 is plenty
        big for this use.  Overprinting generally is to be avoided.
